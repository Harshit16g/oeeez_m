# Phase 2 Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully completed **87.5% of Phase 2** features (7 of 8 items) for the Oeeez Marketplace platform. This represents a major milestone in the project's development roadmap.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Redis Caching Layer ✅

**Purpose:** Optimize performance by caching frequently accessed data and reducing database load.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Location:** `lib/redis/`
- **Technology:** ioredis (Redis client for Node.js)
- **Key Features:**
  - Session storage caching
  - Query result caching (profiles, bookings, notifications)
  - Graceful degradation (app works without Redis)
  - Pattern-based cache invalidation
  - Configurable TTL (Time To Live) values
  
**Cache Keys:**
```typescript
CacheKeys.userProfile(userId)       // User profile data
CacheKeys.userSession(sessionId)    // User session data
CacheKeys.userBookings(userId)      // User bookings list
CacheKeys.userNotifications(userId) // User notifications
CacheKeys.popularArtists()          // Popular artists
CacheKeys.categoryProviders(slug)   // Providers by category
CacheKeys.dashboardStats(userId)    // Dashboard stats
CacheKeys.serviceDetail(serviceId)  // Service details
```

**Setup:**
```bash
# Local development
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Production (Upstash Redis Cloud)
REDIS_URL=rediss://default:token@endpoint.upstash.io:6379
```

### 2. Service Listing System ✅

**Purpose:** Allow users to browse and filter marketplace services across all categories.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Location:** `app/services/page.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - Grid layout with service cards
  - Search across title, description, and category
  - Filter by category (15+ categories)
  - Filter by price range
  - Service cards with images, ratings, location, and pricing
  - Responsive design with dark mode
  
### 3. Review & Rating System ✅

**Purpose:** Enable users to view and manage reviews for services and providers.

**Implementation Details:**
- **Location:** `app/reviews/page.tsx`
- **Features:**
  - View all reviews (given and received)
  - Filter tabs and summary statistics
  - Detailed rating breakdowns
  - Verified purchase badges
  - Social features (helpful votes, replies)
